# ðŸš€ 42MÃ¡laga Projects Repository

Welcome to my **42MÃ¡laga** repository!  
Here you'll find all the projects I've been working on during my time at **42**, the coding school.

I'm incredibly excited to share my progress as I learn and grow through the curriculum. While I'm still learning how to make the most of GitHub, I'll be updating this repository regularly to keep it clean, organized, and professional.

Stay tuned â€” this README will also get better over time! ðŸ˜„
